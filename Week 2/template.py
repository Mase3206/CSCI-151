# Q: Why use argparse instead of sys.argv?
# A: While sys.argv is much simpler, it is much more limited. sys.argv displays
#    the raw python exceptions to the user, which is handy for debugging but is
#    not user-friendly, and doesn't provide any explanation for what the
#    required and optional arguments are. argparse does all of that.
